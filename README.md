## Details of Test Cases - 
### Test Case 1 - 
* Electricity Bill for 45 Units 
* 45 < 50 
* Therefore, 45 x 9 = 405.0

### Test Case 2 - 
* Electricity Bill for 95 Units
* 50 < 95 < 100
* Therefore, (50 x 9) + (45 x 12)=990.0

### Test Case 3 - 
* Electricity Bill for 105 Units
* 100 < 105
* Therefore, (50 x 9) + (50 x 12) + (5 x 15) = 1125.0
